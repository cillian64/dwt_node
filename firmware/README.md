# Firmware
* `r2` is the first firmware revision written in libopencm3 for the original
  L0 teapot boards, marked r2.
* `r2_5` is the firmware for the original teapot boards with an F0 retrofitted.
  This is still the r2 PCB, but with a different STM32 fitted.
* `r3` is the firmware for the new r3 PCBs with an F0, no USB, and the
  Panasonic Grid-eye AMG88 thermopile array.
